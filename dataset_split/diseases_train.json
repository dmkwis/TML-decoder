The disease was first found in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December. On December, Chinese health authorities told the World Health Organization on March. The virus mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is used. The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in Horseshoe bat bats. This then likely infected another animal, possibly a pangolin. It then changed inside that other animal until it could Zoonosis infect humans. Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic. In November, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, said they had finished making COVID vaccines. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over effective. other vaccines have been approved by at least one country, and many others are being developed. The United States has had the most deaths from the virus. Over million Americans have died from the virus. In March, the companies belonging to Sistema allocated about billion rubles for the fight against coronavirus, the bulk of which was spent on the development of tests to detect infection, as well as on the production of protective equipment and antiseptics. In May the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.",

      "article":"Reassortment is mixing of the genes genetic material of a species into new combinations in different individuals. There are several ways this happens. The term is used when two similar viruses infecting the same cell exchange genetic material. In particular, reassortment occurs among Orthomyxoviridae influenza viruses. Their genomes have eight segments of RNA. These segments act like mini chromosomes each time a flu virus is assembled, it needs one copy of each segment. A single host may be infected by two different strains of the influenza virus. Then it is possible that new assembled viral particles will be made from segments whose origin is mixed, some coming from one strain and some coming from another. The new reassorted strain will share properties from both parental lineages. Reassortment is responsible for some of the major changes in the history of the influenza virus. The and pandemic flu strains were caused by reassortment between an avian virus and a human virus. The HN virus responsible for the swine flu pandemic has an unusual mix of swine, avian and human influenza genetic sequences. There are other examples, but this is enough to indicate why reassortment causes such dangerous illness. If any of a virus\u2019s genome segments is damaged in such a way as to prevent replication or expression of an essential gene, the virus is inviable when it, alone, infects a host cell. doi. j. meegid. . . .
