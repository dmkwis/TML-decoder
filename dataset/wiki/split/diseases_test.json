The parasite causes a deadly infection which kills many people each year, and continues to prevail in endemic subendemic proportions, so that Indian population lives in malaria risk areas. Malaria is produced by species of the protozoal parasite Plasmodium, is endemic in many tropical countries. It is one of the most common health problems. As per latest WHO estimates. The parasite that causes malaria is a protozoan called Plasmodium. Protozoa are organisms with only one cell, but they are not bacteria. Bacteria are smaller and simpler than protozoans. People usually get malaria from the Anopheles or Culex mosquitoes they are the Vector vectors of the disease. The Plasmodium gets into people by the bites of mosquitoes. The Plasmodium is in the mosquito s special saliva. The mosquito s saliva injects an anticoagulant into the person to prevent their blood from clotting. The person is then infected with Plasmodium as a by product. This makes the person have the disease we call malaria. Only the female mosquito gives people malaria, because only the female mosquito consumes blood. The male mosquito lives on the nectar of flowers. The female uses blood as a source of protein for its eggs. Some people do not get malaria from mosquitoes. A baby can get it while inside its mother. This is called maternal foetal transmission. People can also get malaria from a blood transfusion. This is when someone gives blood to another person. Another way people can catch malaria is by using a needle that someone with the disease used before them.",

It is common in Central America Central and South America. Carlos Chagas first described it in. Humans are usually infected because they are bitten by a blood sucking bug of the subfamily Triatominae. The disease can also be spread by blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or by eating food contaminated with the parasite. Pregnancy Pregnant women may spread it to the fetus. The disease has four stages. It can be cured by anti parasitic drugs. Between eight and eleven million people may suffer from the disease, but many do not know they are infected. Strategies of controlling the disease are mostly focused on eliminating the insect Vector vector, and on preventing contamination from other sources.",

Researchers say that about million people, in countries, are at a Factor high risk for getting sleeping sickness. In, about, people had African trypanosomiasis. Also, about, more people were getting the disease every year. Medications can treat African trypanosomiasis. The treatment is usually done in a hospital, because the drugs have many adverse effect side effects. For sleeping sickness that was not treated early, the medications used for treatment are based on arsenic, a poison. These medications are dangerous, and about of people die from taking them. The best way to protect against African trypanosomiasis is to protect against insect bites.",

      "article":"Amoebiasis, also known as amebiasis or entamoebiasis, The infection is normally got when someone drinks water with the parasite in it. In some cases, the parasite lives in a person s large intestine and does not cause any symptoms. Symptoms vary from serious to none at all. There may be abdominal pain, mild diarrhoea, dysentery bloody diarrhoea or colitis severe colitis with necrosis tissue death and Gastrointestinal perforation perforation. This last complication may cause peritonitis. People affected may develop anaemia due to loss of blood. Amoebiasis is usually transmitted by water contamination contaminated with faeces. It can also be got indirectly by contact with dirty hands or objects. Infection is spread by ingesting the cyst form of the parasite. This tough and semi dormant structure is found in faeces. Since amoebiasis is transmitted by contaminated food and water, it is often endemic in parts of the world with poor sanitation. Amoebic dysentery is often confused with traveller s diarrhoea because of its prevalence in developing nations. In fact, most traveller s diarrhoea is bacterial or viral in origin. E. histolytica infections occur in both the intestine and in tissue of the intestine and or liver. So, two different classes of drugs are needed to treat the infection, one for each location. Such anti amoebic drugs are known as amoebicides.",

Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences \u2013. Zoonotic diseases can be spread in different ways. They may be spread from a sick animal directly to a human for example, through bites and infected saliva, or through the air. This is called direct zoonosis. Zoonotic diseases can also be spread through a vector vector. This is an animal that carries the pathogen that causes the disease without getting infected. Diseases like this are called vector borne diseases. Sometimes the vector picks up the disease from another animal. For example, rats who have the bubonic plague do not directly infect humans. Instead, fleas bite the rats and pick up the bacteria that causes plague without getting sick. Then, if the flea bites a human, they can pass the bacteria on to the human, and the human can get the plague. The rat is the host host of the disease, and the flea is the vector.",
