Skin bacteria can then grow very quickly. This infection makes the skin become swollen and red, which becomes visible. The face, chest, body back, and upper arms are most common places for acne to happen. Acne is common during puberty, when a person is turning from a child into an adult, because of high levels of hormones. Acne becomes less common as people reach adulthood.

Malaria is produced by species of the protozoal parasite Plasmodium, is endemic in many tropical countries. It is one of the most common health problems. As per latest WHO estimates. The parasite that causes malaria is a protozoan called Plasmodium. Protozoa are organisms with only one cell, but they are not bacteria. Bacteria are smaller and simpler than protozoans. People usually get malaria from the Anopheles or Culex mosquitoes they are the Vector vectors of the disease. The Plasmodium gets into people by the bites of mosquitoes. The Plasmodium is in the mosquito s special saliva. The mosquito s saliva injects an anticoagulant into the person to prevent their blood from clotting. The person is then infected with Plasmodium as a by product. This makes the person have the disease we call malaria. Only the female mosquito gives people malaria, because only the female mosquito consumes blood. The male mosquito lives on the nectar of flowers. The female uses blood as a source of protein for its eggs. Some people do not get malaria from mosquitoes. A baby can get it while inside its mother. This is called maternal foetal transmission. People can also get malaria from a blood transfusion. This is when someone gives blood to another person.

The term is used when two similar viruses infecting the same cell exchange genetic material. In particular, reassortment occurs among Orthomyxoviridae influenza viruses. Their genomes have eight segments of RNA. These segments act like mini chromosomes each time a flu virus is assembled, it needs one copy of each segment. A single host may be infected by two different strains of the influenza virus. Then it is possible that new assembled viral particles will be made from segments whose origin is mixed, some coming from one strain and some coming from another. The new reassorted strain will share properties from both parental lineages. Reassortment is responsible for some of the major changes in the history of the influenza virus. The and pandemic flu strains were caused by reassortment between an avian virus and a human virus. The HN virus responsible for the swine flu pandemic has an unusual mix of swine, avian and human influenza genetic sequences. There are other examples, but this is enough to indicate why reassortment causes such dangerous illness. If any of a virus\u2019s genome segments is damaged in such a way as to prevent replication or expression of an essential gene, the virus is inviable when it, alone, infects a host cell. doi. j. meegid. . . .
